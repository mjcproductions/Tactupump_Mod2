		<h3> Introduction </h3>
		<p>
			The ERS Online Module Framework is a package of code files, HTML/CSS, XML as well as examples and documentation like this one to help improve 
			the process of creating web modules. This framework does its best to mitigate unnecessary work by allowing the mundane and standard elements
			of ERS' web modules to be created with the fewest number of modifications as possible. Changes to the code (JavaScript) are time consuming and
			because of this, the framework attempts to keep the majority of modifications bound to the HTML/CSS and XML files in order to expedite the creation of 
			online modules.  
		</p>
		<p>
			This documentation will explain the framework (including the code, design, CSS/HTML, and data files) used to create web modules, 
			as well as a "how-to" guide for creating the various elements of a web module.

	<!-- The Design: Overview -->
	<div class="topic">
		<a name="designOverview"></a>
		<h3>The Design: Overview</h3>
		<p>
			The code in the framework uses a common design pattern called "MVC", or Model, View, Controller. In short, this design pattern focuses on the separation
			of the Model (data such as XML files), the View (HTML/CSS), and the Controller (code such as JavaScript and PHP). Wherever possible, I have done my best
			to make sure the Controller doesn't unnecessarily leak into the View and vice-versa, unless done for readability purposes (such as static onclick elements in the HTML)
			or simplification/efficiency purposes (such as static HTML/CSS in the config.js file to be dynamically inserted into the DOM).
		</p>
		<p>
			The Model (XML) and the View (HTML/CSS) portions of the framework will be the most often touched when creating a web module.
			For example, if a new module, successor to a completed module, has the same <i>functionality</i> (synonymous with the Controller/code in our design) as the
			previously completed module, then the "js/" directory, or JavaScript code, should go untouched in this scenario. The only files that will need to be edited 
			should be the XML/HTML/CSS files in the framework, as only the Model and View for this hypothetical successor module have changed. If instead, in this example scenario, 
			the new module has some new functionality (such as a new type of animation or navigation function), then the Controller would need to be altered.
		</p>
		<p>
			In short, the goal of the MVC design is to mitigate unnecessary maintenance and alteration of the code, and have as much of the alterations to the framework 
			require only the simplified XML/HTML/CSS files.

	<!-- The Code: Overview -->
	<div class="topic">
		<a name="codeOverview"></a>
		<h3>The Code: Overview</h3>
		<p>
			For a description of any class/file, sometimes the best thing to do is open the file itself as I've been careful to comment each individually more thoroughly then 
			I generally care to recreate in this documentation file. However, I will briefly go over some of the more important classes/files in the framework in plain English
			to speed up the learning process.
		</p>
		<p>
			All code in the module begins in "main.js". In there, several "global" (or technically speaking, singleton) objects are created including the ModuleData object,
			persistent menu objects, navigation object, etc. all of which live under the ERS namespace. The $( document ).ready function initializes the code (grabs any 
			necessary XML and init's various objects) for the module. From here, the module is almost entirely user driven through various interactions (mostly mouse-clicks), 
			with some sections being driven by timed events (such as audio/video playback).
		</p>
		<p>
			The global ModuleData object (accessed in JavaScript with ERS.moduleData), holds any persistent data for the module. This includes XML data for the screens (explained
			below), the current screen object, the current screen number, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			Each "screen" in a module (individual slide with it's own background, audio/video, etc.) is considered a separate Screen object in the framework. The Screen class
			allows various functionality such as visually displaying the given screen (through loadScreen()), and holding data specific to the screen such as background image,
			media file, a list of popup objects, etc. The global ModuleData object (explained above) holds an ordered list of Screen objects, with each one corresponding 
			to a different screen in the module.

		<h3>The Code: Classes</h3>
		<p>
			Each JavaScript class definition sits in a separate .js file, each named in respect to the class within. Each file contains a description that may 
			occasionally explain the class/file in more detail. So if the description below doesn't work for you, please check the file!

	<!-- How To: Screens -->
	<div class="topic">
		<a name="howToScreens"></a>
		<h3>How To: Screens</h3>
		<p>
			Adding a screen to the module is simple. Open the screens.xml file (under media/xml). This file contains all data specific to the screens in the web modules.
			Below is an example screens.xml file, and below that an explanation:
		</p>
		
		<xmp>
		<screenList>
			<screen>
				<name>M1L1S00</name>
				<title>Welcome</title>
				<mediaName></mediaName>
			</screen>
		</screenList>
		</xmp>
		
		<p>
			The example screens.xml code above contains only one screen. In other words, attempting to navigate forward or backward in a module using the above XML 
			would do nothing. The name of the screen, M1L1S00, is contained in the &ltname&gt tags. The title of the screen, 'Welcome', will display at the top of the 
			screen. The &ltmediaName&gt tag, in this case empty, contains the name of an audio or video file for the screen to play (ex: 'M1L1S00.mp3'). The same example XML
			with an audio file can be seen below:
		</p>
		
		<xmp>
		<screenList>
			<screen>
				<name>M1L1S00</name>
				<title>Welcome</title>
				<mediaName>M1L1S00.mp3</mediaName>
			</screen>
		</screenList>
		</xmp>
		
		<p>
			Now that the data for the screen is setup, we need to create this screens content folder which will contain various files needed to display the screen. 
			Continuing with the above example, the new content folder will be located under media/screens and be called M1L1S00. Notice that the new folder in the 
			screens directory (M1L1S00) is identical to the &ltname&gt tag in the screens.xml file above. This is so the Controller (or JavaScript code) can parse the 
			screens.xml file can locate our new screen's content. The content folder should contain an HTML file (in this case called M1L1S00.html), and a background image
			for the screen (called M1L1S00.png). Other additions can be made to this folder to extend this screen's functionality, all of which will be explained in later topics.

	<!-- How To: Buttons -->
	<div class="topic">
		<a name="howToButtons"></a>
		<h3> How To: Buttons </h3>
		<p>
			Buttons are written purely in HTML (along with in-line CSS); there is no JavaScript or XML required. The button's HTML is added to the screen, or popup screen's,
			content folder HTML file. As an example, let's add a button to screen M1L1S00, which when clicked will open a popup on the screen called "pop1". 
			We would first open the HTML file located under media/screens/M1L1S00/M1L1S00.html. Next, add a line to this file similar to the example HTML/CSS below:
		</p>
		
		<xmp>
		<div class="button" data-button=' "open":"pop1" ' style="position:absolute; top:602px; left:364px; width:247px; height:54px;"></div>
		</xmp>
		
		<p>
			The data-button attribute is where all actions (and information regarding those actions) are placed. The format is fairly identical to JSON; each action (such as
			"open") is in quotes, followed by a colon, followed by data about the action in quotes. In this case, when the button is clicked, the button will do one action: open
			the popup named "pop1". The "style" attribute of the above div will normally need to be customized to fit the buttons position. The 'button' class is not required, 
			but is an easy way to change the CSS for all buttons uniformly. Multiple actions can be strung together by separating 
			the actions with commas (again, similar to JSON). Here's an example of a button that will both close a popup named "pop1" and then open another popup named "pop2":
		</p>
		
		<xmp>
		<div class="button" data-button=' "close":"pop1", "open":"pop2" ' style="position:absolute; top:602px; left:364px; width:247px; height:54px;"></div>
		</xmp>
		
		<p>
		All currently usable actions are described below.
			<dl>
			<dt>Button actions (used in the 'data-button' attribute):</dt>
				<dd>- "open":"&ltnameOfPopup&gt" - opens the popup given in &ltnameOfPopup&gt</dd>
				<dd>- "close":"&ltnameOfPopup&gt" - closes the popup given in &ltnameOfPopup&gt</dd>
				<dd>- "flip":"&ltnameOfPopup&gt" - tells the button to "flip" the popup over</dd>
				<dd>- "toggleAudio":"toggleAudio" - this button will toggle the current screen's audio/video element</dd>
				<dd>- "checkBox":"checkBox" - the button will be used as a selectable "checkBox" in a screen containing a multiple choice assessment</dd>
				<dd>- "submit":"submit" - the button will be used as a submit button in a screen containing an assessment</dd>
			</dl>
		</p>
		
		<p>
			NOTE: while first creating buttons, it is often helpful to set the DEBUG_BUTTON_OPACITY variable (located in the config.js file) to true. This will give the buttons
			a slightly transparent coloring for debugging purposes. 
		</p>

	<!-- How To: Popups -->
	<div class="topic">
		<a name="howToPopups"></a>
		<h3> How To: Popups </h3>
		<p>
			A popup in this framework can be simply thought of as another screen, but instead of filling the content area of the module, overlays existing screens.
			This means that popups are not only created in a very similar way to normal screens, but they have the potential for a lot of the same functionality (audio/video,
			animations, etc.). The following screens.xml file example will create one screen with one popup:
		</p>
		
		<xmp>
		<screenList>
			<screen>
				<name>M1L1S00</name>
				<title>Welcome</title>
				
				<popup>
					<name>pop1</name>
					<mediaName></mediaName>
				</popup>
			</screen>
		</screenList>
		</xmp>
		
		<p>
			Again, we use the simple M1L1S00 example from above, however in this case we add another tag <i>inside</i> the &ltscreen&gt tag, &ltpopup&gt.
			If you notice, the children inside the &ltpopup&gt tag look a lot like the original screen XML. This is because popups are treated in a very similar way
			to standard screens, and because of this can use a lot of the same XML data tags.
		</p>
		<p>
			Creating the popup's content folder is also similar to adding a screen's content folder (explained in <a href="#howToScreens">How To: Screens</a>).
			In this case, we will create a new folder under media/screens/M1L1S00 called pop1. Again, we name the folder according to the name in the screens.xml file
			in the &ltname&gt tag. In this folder we can add the same HTML/png and name them like we did in the <a href="#howToScreens">How To: Screens</a> topic section,
			except naming them pop1.html and pop1.png to match the popup's name.
		</p>
		
		<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
	</div>
	
	
	<!-- How To: Animations -->
	<div class="topic">
		<a name="howToAnimations"></a>
		<h3> How To: Animations </h3>
		<p>
			Adding animations to a screen requires the creation of one xml file, and the addition of the images to animate to the given screen's content folder 
			(media/screens/SCREEN_NAME). Explained in more detail, lets say we want to add a couple animated images to the screen M1L1S00. First we must create a new XML file
			under media/screens/M1L1S00 called animations.xml. The framework will automatically look for this file and use the XML contained within to animate the screen.
			Below is the content of this example animations.xml file, and below that an explanation:
		</p>
		
		<xmp>
		<animation>
			<anim>
				<src>M1L1S00-01.png</src>
				<time>0</time>
			</anim>
			<anim>
				<src>M1L1S00-02.png</src>
				<time>2</time>
			</anim>
		</animation>
		</xmp>
		
		<p>
			In the example animations.xml file above, we see several tags. The &ltanim&gt tag denotes a new animation for the screen. In this example, there are going to be two
			animations on screen M1L1S00. Inside the &ltanim&gt tag, the &ltsrc&gt tag is used to denote the name of the image to animate. These images will sit in the folder
			media/screens/M1L1S00, or in the same directory as the animations.xml file. The &lttime&gt tag must always contain an integer number and is used to denote when the 
			animation should appear, in seconds. In this example, the M1L1S00-01.png image will be visible from the start as its &lttime&gt tag is set to zero and the 
			M1L1S00-02.png image will appear after the MediaPlayer plays for 2 seconds.
		</p>
		<p>
			If we wanted to add an "end time", or a denote a time when the image should disappear, to the 2nd animation in the above example, you would simply use the following XML
			in the 2nd anim's place:
		</p>
		
		<xmp>
		<anim>
			<src>M1L1S00-02.png</src>
			<time>2</time>
			<end>4</end>
		</anim>
		</xmp>
		<p>
			In this case, the &ltend&gt tag is telling the above animated image to disappear after the audio has played for 4 seconds.
		</p>
		<p>
			The &ltelement&gt tag allows named HTML elements on the current screen to have timed animations applied to them. By adding a
			'data-animId' tag to any HTML element, the given element can be displayed/hidden based on the media's timing. The following animation.xml
			example shows how to make a button with the tag 'data-animId="btn1"' appear after the media has played for 2 seconds:
		</p>
		
		<xmp>
		<anim>
			<element>btn1</element>
			<time>2</time>
		</anim>
		</xmp>

	<!-- How To: Assessments -->
	<div class="topic">
		<a name="howToAssessments"></a>
		<h3> How To: Assessments </h3>
		<p>
			To add an assessment to the module, there are a few data files that must be altered. The first is the screens.xml data file. Add an assessment
			to any screen by adding the &ltassessment&gt tag within the corresponding &ltscreen&gt node, as in the following example:
		</p>
		<xmp>
		<screenList>
			<screen>
				<name>M1L5S02</name>
				<title>Question 1</title>
				<mediaName></mediaName>
		
				<assessment>
					<type>dragAndDrop</type>
				</assessment>
			</screen>
		</screenList>
		</xmp>
		
		<p>
			The &ltassessment&gt tag can contain the following tags:
			<dl>
			<dt>&lttype&gt - denotes the assessment's general type:</dt>
				<dd>- 'multiple': this assessment is of type 'multiple choice'</dd>
				<dd>- 'dragAndDrop': ... type 'drag and drop' </dd>
			</dl>

	<!-- How To: Assessments: Custom Result Screens -->
	<div class="topic">
		<a name="howToAssessmentsResult"></a>
		<h3> How To: Assessments : Custom Result Screens </h3>
		
		<p>
			Adding custom result screens (popup screen after getting an assessment correct/incorrect) is easy. In the HTML file for the assessment screen,
			simply add a line of HTML such as the following example (can be anywhere in the file):
		</p>
	
		<xmp>
		<img id="incorrect2" style="display:none;" src="media/screens/M1L5S01/incorrect2.png">
		</xmp>
	
		<p>
			The above HTML will replace the result screen's image for this assessment when the user gets the answer wrong twice. The id denotes which result
			to replace (can be "correct", "incorrect1", or "incorrect2").
		</p>
	
	<a href="#top">Back to Top</a>
	</div>
	
	
	<!-- How To: Assessments: Multiple Choice -->
	<div class="topic">
		<a name="howToAssessmentsMultiple"></a>
		<h3> How To: Assessments : Multiple Choice </h3>
		
		<p>
			The following example HTML/CSS is how to add a button to a multiple choice assessment:
		</p>
	
		<xmp>
		<div id='a' class='button checkBox' style='position:absolute; top:231px; left:106px; width:24px; height:24px;'></div>
		</xmp>
		
		<p>
			The id denotes the answer's "name" (to be referenced in the answers.xml file as an answer). The class must be of type "button checkBox". 
			The CSS can be customized.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			To give the assessment an answer, answers.xml requires some XML similar to the following example:
		</p>
	
		<xmp>
		<M1L5S01>
			<answer>a</answer>

		<h3> How To: Assessments : Drag and Drop</h3>
		
		<p>
			The following example HTML/CSS is how to add a draggable item to a drag and drop assessment:
		</p>
	
		<xmp>
		<div id="1" class="draggable" style="position:absolute; top:398px; left:46px; width:831px; height:63px;">
			<img src="media/screens/M1L5S02/M1L5S02-01.png" />
		</div>
		</xmp>
		
		<p>
			The id denotes the draggable object's "name" (to be referenced in the answers.xml file). The &ltimg&gt tag is the background image of the 
			draggable element. The framework will make this element draggable due to the div's class, 'draggable'.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			The following example HTML/CSS is how to add a "dropPos", or position for the draggable element to be dropped on:
		</p>
	
		<xmp>
		<div id="1" class="dropPos" style="position:absolute; z-index:-1; top:182px; left:146px; width:831px; height:63px;"></div>
		</xmp>
		
		<p>
			The id denote's the drop position's "name" (to be referenced in the answers.xml file). The element's class, 'dropPos', will be picked up by 
			the framework automatically and denote this location on the page as a drop position for draggable elements.
		</p>
	
		<p>
			To give the assessment answers, answers.xml requires some XML similar to the following example:
		</p>
	
		<xmp>
		<M1L5S02>
			<answer>
				<drag>drag1</drag>
				<drop>drop1</drop>
			</answer>
			
			<answer>
				<drag>drag2</drag>
				<drop>drop2</drop>
			</answer>
		</M1L5S02>
		</xmp>
		
		<p>
			The above XML creates a series of answers for the drag and drop assessment on screen M1L5S02. Within each &ltanswer&gt tag, two XML tags 
			(&ltdrag&gt and &ltdrop&gt) make an association between a draggable item and a drop position. In this case, the screen has two draggable items,
			with id's drag1 and drag2, and two drop positions, with id's drop1 and drop2. The correct location for drag1 is drop1 and the correct location
			for drag2 is drop2.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Multi-answer drag and drops are simple to implement. Just add more than one set of &ltdrop&gt tags to each answer in the xml.
			IMPORTANT: one thing to remember when creating draggable items with multiple answers is that the first &ltdrop&gt tag for each
			answer will act as that draggable items "default" answer. So when the answers are incorrect and being automatically placed in
			their correct places, this first &ltdrop&gt tag is the location it will be placed.
